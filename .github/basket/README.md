# Node.js HTML Examples

This repository contains a collection of simple HTML files that demonstrate how to connect to a Node.js backend using various methods such as fetching data, sending data, and real-time communication. These examples can serve as a foundation for building more complex applications that interact with a Node.js server.

## Examples Overview

Below is a brief description of each example:

1. **Example 1**: Fetch Data - A simple fetch request to retrieve data from a Node.js server.
2. **Example 2**: Sending Data with POST - Demonstrates how to send data to a Node.js server using a POST request.
3. **Example 3**: Displaying Data from Node.js - Fetches and displays data from the server.
4. **Example 4**: Simple Form Submission - Submits form data to a Node.js endpoint.
5. **Example 5**: Real-time Data with WebSocket - Connects to a WebSocket server for real-time data updates.
6. **Example 6**: Fetching User Data - Retrieves user data from the server.
7. **Example 7**: Displaying a List of Items - Fetches and displays a list of items from the server.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Node.js Server**: Ensure you have a Node.js server running that can handle the endpoints used in these examples. You can use Express.js or any other framework of your choice.

2. **Update URLs**: In each HTML file, replace `https://your-node-server.com` with the actual URL of your Node.js server.

3. **Deploy on GitHub Pages**: 
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Push your HTML files to the repository.
   - Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages to serve the `main` or `gh-pages` branch.

4. **Access Your HTML Files**: Once deployed, you can access your HTML files via the GitHub Pages URL.
