## Overview

This collection of build scripts provides a streamlined approach to building APKs for Android applications. Each script is designed to automate common tasks, making it easier for developers to focus on coding rather than configuration.

## Scripts

### 1. Build APK

A script that compiles the Android project and generates the APK file. This script handles all necessary build configurations and dependencies.

### 2. Clean Project

A script to clean the project by removing build artifacts and temporary files. This is useful for ensuring a fresh build environment.

### 3. Run Tests

A script that executes unit tests and instrumentation tests to ensure the application is functioning as expected before building the APK.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the desired script. For example, to build the APK, run:

```sh
./build-apk.sh
