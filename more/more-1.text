## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can modify.

### 2. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. It’s a good practice to name your branch descriptively. For example:

```sh
git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
3. Make Your Changes
Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Be sure to follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project. If you are
adding new features, consider adding tests to ensure the new functionality works as expected.

4. Test Your Changes
Before submitting your changes, make sure to test them thoroughly. Run the application and ensure that everything is functioning as
expected. If you’ve added or modified tests, run those as well to verify their correctness.

5. Commit Your Changes
Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive commit message. For example:
`git commit -m "Add feature to improve user authentication"`

6. Push to Your Fork
Push your changes to your forked repository:
`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`

7. Open a Pull Request
Navigate to the original repository and open a pull request. Provide a clear description of the changes you’ve made, including any relevant
details or context. This helps the maintainers understand your contribution and its purpose.
